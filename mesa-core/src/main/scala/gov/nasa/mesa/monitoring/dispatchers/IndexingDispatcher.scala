/** Dispatchers in MESA are actors that are used to specify how the monitoring
  * step of the runtime verification is distributed.
  *
  * This trait implements a core functionality for a dispatcher referred to as
  * indexing dispatcher which is used to create monitor objects on-the-fly. It
  * supports indexing at the dispatcher level by storing monitor instances in a
  * hash map. It slices the trace up into sub-traces according to selected data
  * in the trace events, and feeds each resulting sub-trace to the associated
  * monitor object.
  *
  * The type for the monitors created by the dispatcher is specified in the
  * dispatcher actor's config using the key "monitor".
  *
  * To use this functionality, one needs to extend the trait with the
  * handleMessage method implementation which is a partial function that
  * specifies how the actor handles incoming messages.
