/** Dispatchers in MESA are actors that are used to specify how the monitoring
  * step of the runtime verification is distributed.
  *
  * This trait implements a core functionality for a dispatcher, referred to as
  * concurrent dispatcher, which is used to create monitor actors on-the-fly. It
  * supports indexing at the dispatcher level by storing references of monitor
  * actors in a hash map. It slices the trace up into sub-traces according to
  * selected data in the trace events, and feeds each resulting sub-trace to
  * the associated monitor actor.
  *
  * This dispatcher can be used in two settings:
  * 1) Unbounded - in the unbounded setting, one monitor actor is generated for
  * each value of the selected data used as the slicing criteria.
  * 2) Bounded - in the bounded setting, the number of monitor actors are
  * limited to a number specified in the dispatcher's config (using the key
  * "actor-monitor-count"). Therefore, one monitor actor is associated with a
  * set of values of the parameter used as the slicing criteria instead of one
  * value.
  *
  * The type for the monitors created by the dispatcher is specified in the
  * dispatcher actor's config using the key "monitor".
  *
  * To use this functionality, one needs to extend the trait with the
  * handleMessage method implementation which is a partial function that
  * specifies how the actor handles incoming messages.
